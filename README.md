RUN THE PROJECT: 
The Makefile was modified such that you can Run in the Terminal:

make data 
# take the raw data files in data/raw process them into a single tensor, normalize the tensor and save this intermediate representation to the data/processed folder.

make train
# trains the model and saves the training curve to the reports/figures/. 
# the model gets saved as checkpoint.pth in models

make predict
# makes predictions on the training set. Saves the prediction plots in reports/figures/prediction_plots
# gives the overall accuracy of the model
